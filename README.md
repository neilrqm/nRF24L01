# nRF24L01
Driver code for nRF24L01 on 8-bit AVR microcontrollers.

See https://nrqm.ca/nrqm.ca/nrf24l01/index.html for more information.

The trunk code was written for Atmel's AT90USB1287 MCU, there is also Arduino code in the arduino branch.

This code is about 6 years old, but it's worked well.  There's probably some better code floating around (especially for Arduino) by now.  But you're welcome to use this too!
